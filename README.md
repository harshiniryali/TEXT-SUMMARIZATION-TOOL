##This project is a Text Summarization Tool designed to automatically generate concise summaries from long pieces of text. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the tool extracts essential information while preserving the original meaning, making it easier to process large amounts of textual data efficiently.

##Features

**Abstractive & Extractive Summarization** :Supports both methods-abstractive(where summaries are generated in a human-like way) and extractive(where key sentences are selected from the original text).
**Customizable summary length** :Users can adjust the length of summaries based on their needs.
**User-Friendly interface** :Built with a simple and intuitive design for easy interaction.

##Installation

To set up the tool, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshiniryali/TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-TOOL.git
cd TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-TOOL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##Usage

Run the tool using the following command:
python summarize.py --text "Your input text"

##How it works?

**Preprocessing** :Cleans and tokenizes the input text.
**Summarization model** :The trained model generates the summary using either extractive or abstractive techniques.
**Post-Processing** :Ensures the output remains coherent and readable.

##Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve this tool, feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or report issues.
