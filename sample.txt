Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machines and software that can perform tasks which typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. In recent years, AI has advanced rapidly due to improvements in computing power, big data, and machine learning techniques. As a result, AI is being integrated into various industries, which has begun to significantly affect the nature and availability of human jobs. AI tends to replace jobs that require minimal training or decision-making skills. Workers in clerical, assembly line, and basic retail jobs are particularly vulnerable. Since AI systems do not require salaries, breaks, or benefits, companies find it cost-effective to replace low-skilled workers with AI solutions. This displacement creates unemployment or forces workers to shift to different sectors. While AI eliminates certain jobs, it also creates new ones. Fields such as AI development, data science, robotics maintenance, and machine learning engineering are rapidly growing. These jobs require a higher level of education and specialized skills, indicating a shift in the job market toward more technical and analytical roles. This transformation highlights the importance of upskilling and reskilling the workforce. AI is also making inroads into high-skilled professions such as law, medicine, and finance. AI tools can now analyze legal documents, diagnose medical images, and make investment decisions faster than humans. Although this doesn't entirely replace professionals, it reduces the time needed for tasks and shifts their roles toward supervision, interpretation, and decision-making based on AI output.
